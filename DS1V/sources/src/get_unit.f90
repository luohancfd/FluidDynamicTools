subroutine get_unit ( iunit )

!*****************************************************************************80
!
!! GET_UNIT returns a free FORTRAN unit number.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    A "free" FORTRAN unit number is an integer between 1 and 99 which
!    is not currently associated with an I/O device.  A free FORTRAN unit
!    number is needed in order to open a file with the OPEN command.
!
!    If IUNIT = 0, then no free FORTRAN unit could be found, although
!    all 99 units were checked (except for units 5, 6 and 9, which
!    are commonly reserved for console I/O).
!
!    Otherwise, IUNIT is an integer between 1 and 99, representing a
!    free FORTRAN unit.  Note that GET_UNIT assumes that units 5 and 6
!    are special, and will never return those values.
