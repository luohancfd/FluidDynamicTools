# FluidDynamicTools
This repository contains most of the post processing scripts I wrote in my work related to CFD, DSMC, MD and other numerical simulation methods of fluid dynamics. I hope it could make the life of my colleagues easier. Most of the scripts are written in Matlab and python. Feel free to use them and distribute them FREELY. But I don't take any responsibility for the scripts. 

## Plot3D_Tools
These are some matlab scripts to preprocess plot3d format data. They were developed when I was trying to postprocess results calculated from [Eilmer 3](http://cfcfd.mechmining.uq.edu.au/eilmer3.html). So use it carefully and you may need to change some codes. A good reference of plot3d file is [Plot3D Manual](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19900013774.pdf). The scripts include the following ones:
 - *ReadCellGrid.m:* Read Eilmer3 generated cell-centered grid. (You may not need it in your work)
 - *ReadGrid.m:* Read normal plot3d vertex-centered multiblock grid file (ext: g, xyz)
 - *ReadFlowEilmer3.m:* Read plot3d multiblock function file from Eilmer3 (ext: f, fmt)
 - *ReadFlow.m:* Read plot3d multiblock function file
 - *ReadName.m:* Read name file (ext: nam, name)
 - *ConcateBlocks.m:* Merge multiblock grid file and functionfile (Only test for my 2D cases which have uniformed divided multi-block grid)
 - *ExportXYZ.m/ExportFUNCTION.m:* Export correct plot3d format
 - *PLOT3D_post.m:* script to involke the post processing of previous sample
 - _sphere0.*_: Example input of PLOT3D_post script
 - _sphere.*_: Desired output from PLOT3D_post script
Use these scripts with care. In addition, I strongly recommend use [mat2tecplot](https://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/tecplot/103860-mat2tecplot.html) to export the data to tecplot.
